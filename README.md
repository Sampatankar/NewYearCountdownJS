# NewYearCountdownJS
18/20: DOM, Date &amp; Time - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app is a landing page that counts down from the current location's date to the next Gregorian calendar new year.

The project will create a landing page with HTML & CSS.  We calculate the days, hours and minutes to the new year.  The values found will be inserted into the DOM, and we will show a spinner right before loading the countdown.  The coming year will be dynamically shown in the background.

This is the 18th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework.
